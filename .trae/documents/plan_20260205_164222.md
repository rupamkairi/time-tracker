Based on the investigation, the "Problems" encountered are likely due to missing configuration files and uninstalled dependencies, which are common when running a project for the first time.

### Identified Issues:
1.  **Missing Environment Variables**: The project relies on `.env` files for configuration (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `VITE_PUBLIC_API_URL`), but only `.env.example` files exist. This causes runtime errors and connection failures.
2.  **Uninstalled Dependencies**: The `node_modules` directory appears incomplete. The project dependencies need to be installed.
3.  **Build/Lint Errors**: Without the above, the build and lint processes will fail or report numerous errors.

### Plan to Fix:
1.  **Configure Environment**:
    *   Create `packages/database/.env` from `.env.example`. Set `DATABASE_URL="file:local.db"` for a local database.
    *   Create `apps/honoapp/.env` with the same database configuration (required for the backend to connect to the DB).
    *   Create `apps/viteapp/.env` from `.env.example`.
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    *   Run `bun install` to ensure all packages are available.
3.  **Verify & Fix**:
    *   Run `bun run build` to verify the project builds correctly.
    *   Run `bun run lint` (in `apps/viteapp`) to check for any code style issues.
    *   Address any specific errors that appear during the build/lint process.
